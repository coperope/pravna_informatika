The purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on: - classification,\n- packaging, and\n- labelling\nof dangerous substances which are placed on the market in the Member States of the Community.\n2.

The packagings must be so arranged and fastened as to preclude any loss of the contents ; this requirement does not apply where special safety devices are prescribed;\n2. The materials constituting the packaging and fastenings must not be liable to attack by the contents, or liable to form harmful or dangerous compounds with the contents ;\n3. The packagings and fastenings must be strong and solid throughout to ensure that they will not loosen and will safely meet the normal stresses and strains of handling.", "1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that dangerous substances cannot be placed on the market unless the labelling on their packaging satisfies the following requirements.\n2. All packagings must be labelled with: - the name of the substance,\n- the origin of the substance,\n- the danger symbol and indication of danger involved in the use of the substance,\n- a reference to the special risks arising from such dangers;\n(a) the name of the substance must be one of the terms listed in Annex I to this Directive;\n(b) the indication of origin must include the name and address of the manufacturer, the distributor or the importer;\n(c) the following symbols and indications of danger are to be used:\n>PIC FILE= \"T9000048\">\nThe symbols must conform to those in Annex II to this Directive ; they shall be printed in black on an orange-yellow background.\n(d) The nature of the special risks involved in using the substances must be indicated by one or more of the standard phrases which, in conformity with the references contained in the list in Annex I, are set out in Annex III to this Directive.\n3. If the packaging is accompanied by advice on safety precautions relating to the use of the substances, the wording of this shall, in conformity with the references contained in the list in Annex I, be taken from Annex IV to this Directive.", "1. Where the particulars required by Article 6 appear on a label, that label must be placed on one or more surfaces of the packaging so that it can be read horizontally when the package is set down normally. The dimensions of the label must not be less than those of a standard A 8 sheet (52 X 74 mm), but there is no obligation that it exceed those of a standard A 5 sheet (148 x 210 mm). Each symbol must cover et least one-tenth of the surface area of the label. The entire surface of the label must stick to the immediate packaging of the substance.\n2. A label shall not be required where the particulars are clearly printed on the normal packaging as specified in paragraph 1.\n3.

Member States may make the placing on the market of dangerous substances in their territories subject to the use of the national language or languages in the labelling of these substances.\n5. The obligations of paragraphs 1 to 4 concerning labelling shall be regarded as being satisfied where a container is dispatched bearing a label complying with the dispatch requirements and where this label displays the appropriate symbol laid down in Article 6 (2) (c).
