Due to the substantial share of GSP imports represented by the abovementioned countries, their removal from the list of beneficiaries necessitates the amendment of the vulnerability threshold.\n(5) As a result of all the amendments to the list of countries in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 between the entry into force of that Regulation and 1 January 2015, the total imports into the Union from all GSP beneficiary countries taken as an average during the last 3 consecutive years (2011-2013) would decrease to 30,55 %. Therefore, an increase of the vulnerability threshold from 2 % to 6,5 % as from 1 January 2015 would maintain proportionally the same weight of the vulnerability threshold as laid down in Annex VII.\n(6) In line with paragraph 4 of the Common Understanding on delegated acts between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, appropriate and transparent consultations, including at expert level, have been carried out on this Regulation,", "main_body": ["In point 1(b) of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) No 978/2012, the threshold \u20182 %\u2019 is replaced by \u20186,5 %.\u2019", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 9 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0303, 31.10.2012, p.\u00a01.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1421/2013 of 30 October 2013 amending Annexes I, II and IV to Regulation (EU) No\u00a0978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (OJ L\u00a0355, 31.12.2013, p.\u00a01)."}
