The injury elimination level applicable to these companies was determined at 36,5 %\u00a0(5).\n(3) Three of these companies did not cooperate in the parallel anti-subsidy investigation and for that reason their definitive anti-subsidy duty rate was determined at 17,1 %\u00a0(6). The companies concerned are:\n\u2014 Henan Ancai Hi-Tech Co., Ltd,\n\u2014 Henan Succeed Photovoltaic Materials Corporation, and\n\u2014 Zibo Jinxing Glass Co. Ltd.\n(4) Pursuant to recital 167 of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping duties, in parallel investigations where the subsidy margins are lower than the injury elimination level, the definitive anti-subsidy duty should be imposed at the level of the established subsidy margins and the definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed up to the relevant injury elimination level.\n(5) On that basis, for the three companies that cooperated in the anti-dumping investigation but did not cooperate in the parallel anti-subsidy investigation, the rate at which the anti-dumping and the anti-subsidy duties should be imposed should be set as follows:\nCompany Subsidy margin Dumping margin Injury elimination level Countervailing (anti-subsidy) duty Anti-dumping duty\nOther cooperating companies in the anti-dumping investigation, but not in the parallel anti-subsidy investigation 17,1 % 84,7 % 36,5 % 17,1 % 19,4 %\n(6) It follows that recital 167 of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping duties should also contain the information about the three companies as presented in the preceding recital.\n(7) It also follows that Article 1(2) of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping duties should be amended accordingly.\n(8) If the amount of any duties paid or entered into the accounts in accordance with Article 1(2) of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping duties exceeds those due under the present Regulation, that amount should be repaid or remitted.
