Thereupon, the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, provided the statistical data for the application of the said Protocol;\n(b) in accordance with Article 104c (3) of the Treaty, the Commission prepared, in April 1996, a report on Germany which takes account of the relevant factors;\n(c) in accordance with Article 104c (4) of the Treaty, the Monetary Committee formulated an opinion on the report of the Commission;\n(d) the Commission considers that an excessive deficit exists in Germany;\nWhereas Article 104c (6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before the Council decides, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists; whereas this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions:\nGermany has made considerable efforts to cope with the expenditure needs created by unification. The government deficit to GDP ratio was gradually reduced, with the temporary exception of 1993, and stood at 2,5 % of GDP in 1994. However, the decline of the deficit in Germany was reversed in 1995, when the deficit rose to 3,5 % of GDP, only partly due due to weaker growth. The Government deficit was reported by the German Federal Government, in February 1996, to be 3,6 % for 1996. The deficit as forecast by the Commission services for the year 1996 is 3,9 % of GDP. The planned deficit for 1996 is therefore in excess of the Treaty reference value;\nWhereas, regarding the medium-term economic and budgetary position of Germany, the evolution of the gross Government debt as a ratio of GDP suggests that the ratio, having reached 58,1 % in 1995, is projected to increase further by several percentage points in 1996;\nWhereas Article 3 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure lays down that the governments of the Member States are responsible for the deficits of general government as defined in the first indent of Article 2 of that Protocol;\nWhereas a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated, in accordance with the provisions of Article 104c (12) of the Treaty, when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected,", "main_body": ["From an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Germany.", "This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany."], "attachments": "Done at Luxembourg, 27 June 1996.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.
