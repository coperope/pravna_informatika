whereas the definition of small craft industry, and hence the dividing-line between small craft activities and industrial activities, varies from one Member State to another ; whereas, moreover, while in some cases there is freedom to take up and pursue small craft activities, in other cases there are stringent provisions making the taking up and pursuit of those activities subject to possession of formal qualifications;\nWhereas the Council, at the time of approving the General Programmes, found that in respect of small craft industries co-ordination and recognition posed problems, the solution of which requires detailed preparation;\nWhereas it is therefore not possible to effect the co-ordination provided for at the same time as the abolition of restrictions ; whereas such co-ordination must be effected at a later date;\nWhereas, in the absence of immediate co-ordination, it nevertheless appears desirable to make it easier to attain freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities in question by the adoption of transitional measures of the kind envisaged in the General Programmes ; whereas this should be done primarily in order to avoid causing exceptional difficulties for nationals of Member States in which the taking up of such activities is not subject to any conditions;\nWhereas, in order to prevent such difficulties arising, the main object of the transitional measures should be to allow, as sufficient qualification for taking up the activities in question in host States which have rules governing the taking up of such activities, the fact that the occupation has been pursued for a  1 OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.  2 OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 32/62.  3 OJ No 182, 12.12.1963, p. 2895/63.  4 OJ No 117, 23.7.1964, p. 1869/64.  reasonable period of time in the country whence the person concerned comes, such period being, in cases where no previous training is required, sufficiently recent to ensure that such person possesses professional knowlege equivalent to that required of the host country's own nationals;\nWhereas, as regards States which do not make the taking up of the activities in question subject to any rules, in order to avoid a disproportionate influx into those States of persons who are unable to satisfy the conditions laid down in respect of the taking up and pursuit of such activities in the country whence they come, provision should be made for those States to be authorised, where appropriate and in respect of one or more activities, to require nationals of other Member States to furnish proof that they are qualified to pursue the activity in question in the country whence they come;\nWhereas, however, considerable caution should be exercised in granting such authorisations, for, if too generally applied, they might hinder freedom of movement ; whereas they should therefore be limited, both as to their period of validity and as to their scope, and, as is generally provided in the Treaty in respect of the administration of protective measures, the granting of such authorisations should be entrusted to the Commission;\nWhereas the main purpose of the measures provided for in this Directive will disappear once the co-ordination of conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question and the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal evidence of qualifications has been achieved;", "main_body": ["1. Member States, acting in accordance with the provisions hereinafter laid down, shall adopt the following transitional measures in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons or companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes (hereinafter called \"beneficiaries\") wishing to engage in activities as self-employed persons in manufacturing and processing industries.\n2.

The competent authority designated for this purpose by the country whence the beneficiary comes shall certify what professional activities were actually pursued by the beneficiary and the duration of those activities. Certificates shall be drawn up having regard to the official description of the occupation in question supplied by the Member State in which the beneficiary wishes to pursue such occupation, whether permanently or temporarily.\n3. The host Member State shall grant authorisation to pursue the activity in question on application by the person concerned, provided that the activity certified conforms to the main features of the description of the activity communicated pursuant to paragraph 1 and provided that any other requirements laid down by the rules of that State are satisfied.", "1. Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is not subject to the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge or ability, that State may, if serious difficulties result from the application of the Council Directive referred to in Article 1 (2), request from the Commission authorisation, for a limited period and in respect of one or more specified activities, to require from nationals of other Member States who wish to pursue those activities in its territory proof that they possess the qualifications required for the pursuit of such activities in the country whence they come.\nUse shall not be made of this power in respect of a person who comes from a country which does not make the taking up of the activity in question subject to proof of particular knowledge, or in respect of a person who has lived in the host country for at least five years.\n2. On receipt of a request from the Member State concerned stating the reasons on which it is based, the Commission shall forthwith specify the conditions on which the authorisation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article will be granted and lay down detailed rules concerning its implementation.\n3.
